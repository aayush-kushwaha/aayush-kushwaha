<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Aayush Kushwaha</h1>
<h2 align="center">Software Engineer at DigitalPetro Pvt. Ltd.</h1>
<p align="center">DigitalPetro Pvt. Ltd. is an innovative organization committed to modernizing traditional petrol stations through the use of fully cloud-based automation technologies employing IOT devices. As a Software/Backend Developer, I am responsible for managing and processing incoming data from IOT devices embedded with sensors. These devices read and send data to thingsboard using MQTT protocol.

In my role, I perform complex calculations, such as product density and temperature, on the incoming data from IOT devices. I then transform the data into desirable JSON format, while implementing alerts for high fuel level, low fuel level, high temperature, density mismatch, and preset mismatch using JavaScript code in thingsboard. I have also developed good capabilities of exception handling.

My responsibilities also include writing backend code using Python(FastAPI) to fetch the data and insert it into elastic search using redis queue. I developed backend code for volume calculation for tank data, where the data that comes in mm has to be converted to litres based on the tank calibration chart provided by Retail Outlet. I have created sheet upload API and based on the tank device from the respective Retail Outlet, calculate the volume for the specific tank.

In addition, I am skilled at establishing relationships between data in NoSQL databases. Throughout my tenure as a Software/Backend Developer at DigitalPetro Pvt. Ltd., I continue to hone my logical ability, which helps me excel in coding and debugging complex applications.DigitalPetro Pvt.
